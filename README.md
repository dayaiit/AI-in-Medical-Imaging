# AI-Enhanced Vascular Flow Analysis System (AIVFAS)

## Project Overview
This repository contains the development of an AI system that predicts blood flow patterns from static vessel images, leveraging deep learning and physics-informed neural networks. The system aims to provide real-time flow predictions that are 50-100x faster than traditional CFD approaches while maintaining clinical accuracy.

### Key Components
- Vessel segmentation using deep learning
- Physics-informed neural networks for flow prediction
- Web interface for clinical deployment

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1:** Data preprocessing and vessel segmentation (Current)
- **Phase 2:** Physics-informed flow prediction
- **Phase 3:** Clinical validation and interface development

## Technical Stack
- PyTorch for deep learning models
- SimpleITK for medical image processing
- MONAI for medical-specific deep learning components
- Flask/FastAPI for API development (future)

## Getting Started
